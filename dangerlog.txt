1. Our algorithm is quite complex, through comparing with other people, they may run 1000 requests in less than 30 seconds, we need 2 minute, for next homeworks we need to refine the algorithm
2. We use very naive multi-thread lock , to lock the whole big part, which can cause lots of time, but at first, when we don't have lock, muti-thread test has the risk to fail.
3. we only create 4 tables in the database which may not be enough, to complete all transactions, we wrote a lot of helper functions
4. Our return for malformed request at first is not an XML,but may not reasonable, we changed to XML response later.
5. We used native SQL queries, which is very quite complex, we may choose ORM in next projects
